My name is Matthew Mariano and my piece is entitled "Vestige of Time".  I
am a fourth semester student here at Berklee College of Music.  I have been
doing C Sound for four months.  This piece was my final project for my
C Sound class.  

Most everything I have been experimenting with found its way into this
piece.  There are a few instruments in my orchestra that arent used in the
piece and I never removed from the file.  This is also true with some of my
functions in the score file.  I suppose I will eventually hunt down which
aren't used and remove them to streamline my files and the running time of
the job.  There are also a few init errors in the first of second section
of the score I never got around to fixing.  With the tight deadlines here I
had to cut some corners.

There is a group of sounds I based on the vocal formants given in the
"Dodge" book.  They aren't extremely realistic but they do produce some
very nice timbres.  To create them I used a buzz unit generator and
filtered it with reasonating filters at the formant frequencies and
adjusted the bandwidth of each.
