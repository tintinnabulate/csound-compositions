# csound-compositions

Here is a collection of pieces of music made using the computer program
"Csound", developed by Barry Vercoe at the Massachussetts Institute of
Technology from the seventies on. None of the sounds that appear in these
tracks come from the physical world, but from a process of calculation
performed by a computer(*). To create a piece, a composer prepares two files:
one is the orchestra, which describes the internal structure of the instruments
that will be required during the execution of the piece, made of oscillators,
filters and similar, and the other is the score, which specifies when these
instruments should fire in time, at what musical frequency, the length of each
note and a series of parameters for each note to modify the precise sound of
each. The Csound program reads these two files and creates a sound track that
can then be played.

There is only one piece of mine here; for the rest I just copied the orchestras
and scores from the Internet, ran the synthesis with Csound, and recorded the
resulting sound tracks. For further information on Csound, on the pieces and on
the composers, search for "Csound Frontpage" on the Internet. 

(*) Except where samples are used: in Nuclear for the four drum sounds and in
Laugh, which uses three samples of the author laughing which are then
transformed. 

Note: The composition entitled 'Unwanted' currently doesn't build
