"Deserted" summary

"Deserted" was inspired by my experiences at the Berklee College of Music under the instruction of Dr. Richard Boulanger during the spring of 1997. 
Many of the instruments were created by modeling the designs of Jean-Claude Risset and John Chowning ("Computer Music" Dodge-Jerse).  These
instruments were born out of the process of studying various types of synthesis including FM, AM, Subtractive, Additive and Ring Modulation.  Others
were created by modifying existing instruments designed by John Fitch.  During the creation of this premier composition, I quickly realized the
virtually unlimited capabilities of csound as a music synthesist's tool for sound design, real time signal processing and artistic expression.
