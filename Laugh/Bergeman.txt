HELLO!!!!!!!

My name is Michael Jude Bergeman. The 7 remaining files in this folder are the 
orchestras and scores for my first two CSound compositions and three sound files 
used in one of the pieces. CSound is an exciting new way to make sounds (orchestra) 
and use these sounds to create music (score). The aspect of CSound that I find most
fascinating (and challenging) is its unlimited potential. If you are determined enough
you can create any sound(s) that you can imagine. The key to making things work are a
good imagination and a strong will to translate these ideas into a language that 
CSound understands. Work hard and try not to get discouraged and you will be creating
sounds that you have only dreamed about.


"Face On Mars" is my first CSound piece. It was inspired by the research of Richard
Hoagland. In his book, THE MONUMENTS OF MARS, he presents conclusive evidence of a
former advanced civilization on Mars. The evidence is based on pictures taken from
probes sent up to Mars in the 1970's. These pictures reveal artificial structures 
that communicate redundant mathematical formulas through their alignment on the
Martian surface. These mathmatical formulas point the way to a "new" untapped energy
source available in the Universe. 
Unfortunately, there is much debate regarding the accuracy of Hoagland's findings.
To complicate things further, since the mid 80's every probe sent to Mars either 
by Russia (Phobos) or the United States (Mars Observer) has been lost.
I am frustrated by the fact that we could send probes out of our solar system and 
land people on the moon in the 70's, but can't even get a probe to Mars in the 90's.  
New pictures focused on this area of Mars would silence the critics of Hoagland's
theories and reveal a deeper truth about humanity and its existence. Someone or 
something does not want this to happen.


"The Beauty of Laughter" is my second CSound composition. It was written to celebrate
the 25th annual Bourges' Electroacoustic Music Festival in France. I chose this title
because I was fortunate enough to win first prize in the music and humor category
of the competition in 1994 with my piece "The Hershe Tube Rundown". 
"The Beauty of Laughter" was composed by first creating samples of myself laughing 
when I was five. These samples were then read into CSound and manipulated in different ways. I also used a few other instruments to balance things out.
